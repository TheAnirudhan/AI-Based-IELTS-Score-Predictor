# AI-Based-IELTS-Score-Predictor
The Objective is to provide students with a learning system which could enhance their IELTS score. s a self-assessing system that helps students to perform better in their exam. It is a user-friendly web application that allows ease of learning. This is an AI based learning system which aims at facilitating the students who could not afford to pay for a professional training course. The project guides them to get a good grade in the exam. Also, the result provides transparency on the parameters that are used to determine the score.The most challenging part of the exam is speaking and writing. It is not possible to evaluate those by themselves, this project helps them assess themselves better.
The writing part is evaluated based on lexical resources, coherence and cohesion, grammatical range and accuracy, and task achievement. The speaking part is evaluated based on lexical resources, grammatical accuracy and coherence. For assessing pronunciation, the speech is converted into International Phonetic Alphabets (IPA) and is in turn converted into text for evaluation.
When comparing the scores given by the IELTS and our system to evaluate answer samples from students on the internet, we found an accuracy rate of around 85%.
